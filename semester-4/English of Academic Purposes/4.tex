Why is listening to foreign lang so difficult?
\begin{notation}
    A new born child is potential to speak any lang, but it will hear only those sounds of its own lang.
\end{notation}
Let's find out the factors which make it difficult to hear clearly:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The speed
    \item Backgound noise
    \item accent

    \begin{itemize}
        \item students is too few
        \item time range not enough
        \item \ldots 
    \end{itemize}
\end{notation}
he find out, in China: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item undergraduate lectures has more contents
    \item they only give back sayings to the lecturer
    \item not very interactive
    \item main points are often splited by the lecturer
    \item the importance of knowledge is defined by lecturer
    \item one course book for each course
    \item less reading on course book
\end{itemize}
in the UK:
\begin{itemize}
    \item students not only give back lecturer says
    \item many books, articles for one course
    \item lecturer respect students' right to discussion
    \item interactive is important
    \item not able to pass the exam if only study in notes
\end{itemize}
